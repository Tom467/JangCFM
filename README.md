'N'umerical investigation of the generalized Jang equation coupled to conformal flow of metrics'' by Hollis Williams

The codes implement a spherically symmetric numerical formulation of the generalized Jang equation coupled to the conformal flow of metrics, restricted to time-symmetric initial data. The primary goal is to study the global behavior of the Jang slope variable and its potential breakdown, following and extending the analysis of Jaracz (CQG 2023).

Overview

The repository includes scripts to:

- Solve the harmonic equation for the conformal flow in spherical symmetry
- Construct the conformal factor and warping function
- Integrate the reduced Jang slope equation
- Test robustness under controlled perturbations of the warping factor
- Reproduce the figures appearing in the paper

All computations are performed in geometric units with mass parameter \( M = 1 \).
